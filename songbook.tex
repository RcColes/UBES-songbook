\section{Bones in the Ocean}
\begin{xverse}
Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land \\*
And I paddle away from brave England’s white sands \\*
To search for my long ago forgotten friends \\*
To search for the place I hear all sailors’ end \\*
As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind \\*
I’ll search without sleeping till peace I can find \\*
I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea \\*
I remember the fallen, do they think of me? \\*
When their bones in the ocean forever will be

Plot a course thro’ the night to a place I once knew \\*
To a place where my hope died along with my crew \\*
So I swallow my grief and face life’s final test \\*
To find promise of peace and the solace of rest \\*
As the songs of the dead fill the space of my ears \\*
Their laughter like children, their beckoning cheers \\*
My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea \\*
I remember the fallen, do they think of me? \\*
When their bones in the ocean forever will be

When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand \\*
I shed a small tear for my home upon land \\*
Though their eyes speak of depths filled with struggle and strife \\*
Their smiles below say I don’t owe them my life \\*
As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes \\*
And my boat listed over and tried to capsize. \\*
I’m this far from drowning, this far from the sea, \\*
I remember the living do they think of me? \\*
When my bones in the ocean forever will be.

Now that I’m staring down at the darkest abyss \\*
I’m not sure what I want but I don’t think it’s this \\*
As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on \\*
I make sail for the dawn till the darkness has gone \\*
As the souls of the dead live fore’er in my mind \\*
As I live all the years that they left me behind \\*
I’ll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea \\*
I remember the fallen and they think of me \\*
For our souls in the ocean together will be. \\*
I remember the fallen and they think of me, \\*
For our souls in the ocean together will be
\end{xverse}

\section{Santiana}
\begin{xverse}
Oh Santiana gained the day \\*
Away Santiana \\*
Now pulled the yan up the west they say \\*
Along the plains of Mexico

\chorusdef
Well heave her up and away we’ll go \\*
Away Santiana \\*
Heave her up and away we’ll go \\*
Along the plains of Mexico

She’s a fast clipper ship and a bully good crew \\*
Away Santiana \\*
And an old salty Yank for a captain too \\*
Along the plains of Mexico

\chorusmark

Santiana fought for gold \\*
Away Santiana \\*
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow \\*
Along the plains of Mexico

\chorusmark

’Twas on the field of Molly-Del-Rey \\*
Away Santiana \\*
Well both his legs got blown away \\*
Along the plains of Mexico

\chorusmark

It was a fierce and bitter strife \\*
Away Santiana \\*
The general Taylor took his life \\*
Along the plains of Mexico

\chorusmark

Santiana now we mourn \\*
Away Santiana \\*
We left him buried off Cape Horn \\*
Along the plains of Mexico
\end{xverse}


\section{Loch Lomond}

\begin{xverse}
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes, \\*
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond, \\*
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae, \\*
In the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

\chorusdef
O ye’ll take the high road, and I’ll take the low road, \\*
And I’ll be in Scotland afore ye, \\*
Where me and my true love will never meet again, \\*
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

’Twas there that we parted, in by yon shady glen, \\*
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond, \\*
Where, deep in purple hue, the highland hills we view, \\*
And the moon coming out in the gloaming.

\chorusmark

The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring, \\*
And in sunshine waters lie sleeping. \\*
But the broken heart it kens, nae second spring again, \\*
Though the waeful may cease frae their greeting.

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Beeswing}
\begin{xverse}
I was 18 when I came to town they called it the summer of love \\*
Burning babies burning flags the hawks against the doves \\*
I took a job at the steaming way down on Caltrim St, \\*
Fell in love with a laundry girl that was workin’ next to me. \\*
Brown hair zig zagged across her face and a look of half surprise, \\*
Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes, \\*
She said to me can’t you see I’m not the factory kind, \\*
If you don’t take me out of here I’ll surely lose my mind

\chorusdef
She was a rare thing fine as a bee’s wing \\*
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away \\*
She was a lost child, she was runnin’ wild (she said) \\*
So long as there’s no price on love I’ll stay \\*
You wouldn’t want me any other way.

We busked around the market towns fruit pickin’ down in Kent \\*
We could tinker pots and pans or knives wherever we went. \\*
We were campin down the Gower one time, the work was mighty good. \\*
She wouldn’t wait for the harvest, I thought we should. \\*
I said to her we’ll settle down, get a few acres dug, \\*
A fire burning in the hearth and babbies on the rug. \\*
She said Oh man you foolish man that surely sounds like hell, \\*
You might be lord of half the world,You’ll not own me as well

\chorusmark

We were drinking more in those days our tempers reached a pitch \\*
Like a fool I let her run away when she took the rambling itch. \\*
Last I heard she was living rough back on the Derby beat \\*
A bottle of White Horse in her pocket, a Wolfhound at her feet

They say that she got married once to a man called Romany Brown \\*
Even a gypsy caravan was too much like settlin’ down \\*
They say her rose has faded, rough weather and hard booze, \\*
Maybe thats the price you pay for the chains that you refuse

She was a rare thing, fine as a bee’s wing \\*
I miss her more than ever words can say \\*
If I could just taste all of her wildness now \\*
If I could hold her in my arms today… \\*
I wouldn’t want her any other way
\end{xverse}

\section{Leave her, Johnny}

\begin{xverse}
I thought I heard the Old Man say: \\*
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.” \\*
Tomorrow you will get your pay \\*
And it’s time for us to leave her

\chorusdef
Leave her, Johnny, leave her! \\*
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her! \\*
For the voyage is long and the winds don’t blow \\*
And it’s time for us to leave her

Oh, the wind was foul and the sea ran high \\*
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her!” \\*
She shipped it green and none went by \\*
And it’s time for us to leave her

\chorusmark

I hate to sail on this rotten tub \\*
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her!” \\*
No grog allowed and rotten grub \\*
And it’s time for us to leave her

\chorusmark

We swear by rote for want of more \\*
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her!” \\*
But now we’re through so we’ll go on shore \\*
And it’s time for us to leave her

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Northwest Passage}

\begin{xverse}
\chorusdef
Ah, for just one time \\*
I would take the Northwest Passage \\*
To find the hand of Franklin \\*
Reaching for the Beaufort Sea \\*
Tracing one warm line \\*
Through a land so wild and savage \\*
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea \\*
Westward from the Davis Strait

’Tis there ’twas said to lie \\*
The sea route to the Orient \\*
For which so many died \\*
Seeking gold and glory, \\*
Leaving weathered, broken bones \\*
And a long-forgotten lonely cairn of stones

\chorusmark

Three centuries thereafter \\*
I take passage overland \\*
In the footsteps of brave Kelso \\*
Where his “sea of flowers” began \\*
Watching cities rise before me \\*
Then behind me sink again \\*
This tardiest explorer \\*
Driving hard across the plain

\chorusmark

And through the night, behind the wheel \\*
The mileage clicking west \\*
I think upon Mackenzie, \\*
David Thompson and the rest \\*
Who cracked the mountain ramparts \\*
And did show a path for me \\*
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea

\chorusmark

How then am I so different \\*
From the first men through this way? \\*
Like them, I left a settled life \\*
I threw it all away \\*
To seek a Northwest Passage \\*
At the call of many men \\*
To find there but the road back home again

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{The Mingulay Boat Song}

\begin{xverse}
\chorusdef
Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\*
Heave her head round to the weather \\*
Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\*
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

What care we though white the Minch is \\*
What care we boys the wind and weather \\*
When we know that, every inch is \\*
Closer homeward to Mingulay

\chorusmark

Wives are waiting by the pierhead \\*
Gazing seaward from the heather \\*
Heave ahead round and we’ll anchor \\*
Ere the sun sets on Mingulay

Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\*
Heave her head round to the weather \\*
Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\*
Sailing homeward to Mingulay \\*
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
\end{xverse}


\section{The Skye Boat Song}

\begin{xverse}
\chorusdef
Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing \\*
Onward the sailors cry. \\*
Carry the lad that’s born to be king \\*
Over the sea to Skye

Loud the wind howls \\*
Loud the waves roar \\*
Thunderclaps rend the air \\*
Baffled our foes \\*
Stand by the shore \\*
Follow they will not dare

\chorusmark

Many’s the lad fought on that day \\*
Well the claymore did wield \\*
When the night came \\*
Silently lain \\*
Dead on Colloden field

\chorusmark

Though the waves heave \\*
Soft will ye sleep \\*
Ocean’s a royal bed \\*
Rocked in the deep \\*
Flora will keep \\*
Watch by your weary head

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Wild Mountain Thyme}

\begin{xverse}
O the summer time has come \\*
And the trees are sweetly bloomin’ \\*
And the wild mountain thyme \\*
Grows around the bloomin’ heather \\*
Will ye go, Lassie, go?

\chorusdef
And we’ll all go together \\*
To pull wild mountain thyme \\*
All around the bloomin’ heather \\*
Will ye go, Lassie, go?

I will build my love a bower \\*
By yon cool crystal fountain \\*
And round it I will pile \\*
All the wild flowers o’ the mountain \\*
Will ye go, Lassie, go?

\chorusmark

I will range through the wilds \\*
And the deep glen sae dreamy \\*
And return wi’ their spoils \\*
Tae the bower o’ my dearie \\*
Will ye go, Lassie, go?

\chorusmark

If my true love she’ll not come \\*
Then I’ll surely find another \\*
To pull wild mountain thyme \\*
All around the bloomin’ heather \\*
Will ye go, Lassie, go?

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{The Wild Rover}

\begin{xverse}
I’ve been a wild rover for many’s the year \\*
And I’ve spent all me money on whiskey and beer \\*
But now I’m returning with gold in great store \\*
And I never will play the wild rover no more

\chorusdef
And it’s no, nay, never \\*
No, nay, never no more \\*
Will I play the wild rover \\*
No, never no more

I went into an alehouse I used to frequent \\*
And I told the landlady me money was spent \\*
I asked her for credit, she answered me “nay” \\*
“Such a custom as yours I can have every day”

\chorusmark

I then took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright \\*
And the landlady’s eyes opened wide with delight \\*
She says “I have whiskeys and wines of the best” \\*
And the words that you told me were only in jest

\chorusmark

I’ll go home to my parents, confess what I’d done \\*
And I’ll ask them to pardon their prodigal son \\*
And when they’ve caressed me as ofttimes before \\*
I never will play the wild rover no more

\chorusmark[2]
\end{xverse}

\section{Caledonia}

\begin{xverse}
I don’t know if you can see \\*
the changes that have come over me \\*
In these last few days I’ve been afraid \\*
that I might drift away \\*
So I’ve been telling old stories, singing songs \\*
that make me think about where I come from \\*
And that’s the reason why I seem so far away today

\chorusdef
Oh and let me tell you that I love you \\*
and I think about you all the time \\*
Caledonia, you’re calling me and now I’m going home \\*
If I should become a stranger \\*
you know that it would make me more than sad \\*
Caledonia’s been everything I’ve ever had

Oh and I have moved on and I’ve kept on moving \\*
proved the points that I needed proving \\*
Lost the friends that I needed losing \\*
found others on the way \\*
Oh and I have tried and I’ve kept on trying \\*
stolen dreams, yes there’s no denying \\*
I have travelled hard, with my conscience flying, \\*
somewhere with the wind

\chorusmark

Now I’m sitting here before the fire \\*
the empty room, the forest choir \\*
The flames that couldn’t get any higher \\*
they’ve withered now they’ve gone \\*
But I’m steady thinking, my way is clear \\*
and I know what I will do tomorrow \\*
When the hands have shaken and the kisses flowed \\*
then I will disappear

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Rocky Road to Dublin}

\begin{xverse}
While in the merry month of May, now from me home I started \\*
Left, the girls of Tuam were nearly broken-hearted \\*
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother \\*
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother \\*
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born \\*
Cut a stout, black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins \\*
A brand-new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs \\*
And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

\chorusdef
One, two, three, four, five \\*
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road \\*
And all the way to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary \\*
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early \\*
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from shrinking \\*
That’s the Paddy’s cure whene’er he’s on for drinking \\*
To hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while \\*
At me curious style, ’twould set your heart a-bubblin’ \\*
They asked me was I hired and wages I required to lay \\*
Was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

\chorusmark

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity \\*
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city \\*
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality \\*
Bundle it was stolen, in a neat locality \\*
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind \\*
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin’ \\*
’Quiring after the rogue, said me Connaught brogue \\*
It wasn’t much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

\chorusmark

From there I got away, me spirits never falling \\*
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing \\*
Captain at me roared, said that no room had he \\*
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy \\*
Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs \\*
I played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling \\*
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead \\*
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin

\chorusmark

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed \\*
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it \\*
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing \\*
Poor old Erin’s Isle they began abusing \\*
“Hurrah me soul” says I, me Shillelagh I let fly \\*
Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin’ \\*
With a “lo!” and “hurray!” they joined in the affray \\*
Quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Whiskey in the Jar}

\begin{xverse}
It’s as I was going over the Cork and Kerry Mountains \\*
I met with Captain Farrel and his money he was countin’ \\*
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier \\*
sayin’, “stand and deliver for I am your bold deceiver:

\chorusdef
mush a ring a ma dor um dah \gray{(4 claps)} \\*
whack for the daddy Oh \gray{(2 claps)} \\*
whack for the daddy Oh \\*
there’s whiskey in the jar \gray{(yell “HEY” with a simultaneous clap)}

I counted up my money and it made a pretty penny \\*
I took that money home and I gave it to my Jenny \\*
she promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me \\*
but the devil take the women for they never can be easy

\chorusmark

I went into my chamber for to take a little slumber \\*
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder \\*
but Jenny took my charges and filled them up with water \\*
and sent for Captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter

\chorusmark

It was early in the mornin’ before I rose to travel \\*
surrounded by the footmen and likewise Captain Farrel \\*
I went for my old pistol for they’d stolen my old rapier \\*
but I couldn’t shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken

\chorusmark

If anyone can save me it’s my brother in the army \\*
I think that he is stationed in Cork or in Killarney \\*
and if he would be here we’d be rovin’ in Kilkenny \\*
I know he’d treat be better than my darlin’ sportin’ Jenny

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Retirement Song}

\begin{xverse}
I’ve been roaming all my life, \\*
And now I’ve found a lady wife, \\*
I’m staying, right here. \\*
Oh, I won’t go sailing anymore, \\*
I won’t obey the oceans call, \\*
I’m staying right here.

\chorusdef
I’ll be a man of the land, \\*
I’ll be a man of the trees, \\*
I’ll be a man, wherever my woman will be. \\*
I won’t be any captains mate, \\*
I won’t be servant of the seas; \\*
’Cause this pretty little woman is all I need.

At 14 I was cabin boy \\*
To fearsome Captain Buckleroy, \\*
I’m staying right here. \\*
When I was sick he ordered cat-a-nine, \\*
Until I said that I felt fine, \\*
I’m staying right here,

\chorusmark

At 20 I manned that crow’s nest \\*
And captain said “I was the best”, \\*
I’m staying right here, \\*
But I nearly lost my eyes to god, \\*
Just looking out for old cape cod, \\*
I’m staying right here.

\chorusmark

At 25 no man alive \\*
Could match my skills for gun’en, \\*
I’m staying right here, \\*
But the Captain he got drunk one night \\*
And sank the blasted cannon, \\*
I’m staying right here,

\chorusmark

Captain died at 28 \\*
And by then I was his first mate, \\*
I’m staying right here \\*
Oh they tried to give me his command \\*
But I was hungry for the land, \\*
I’m staying right here,

\chorusmark

Stepped ashore at Felixstowe \\*
And made for Bristol by the road, \\*
I’m staying right here, \\*
Well I fell in love, when, first, I saw, her, \\*
Avon county’s finest daughter, \\*
And now she’s got me staying right here, \\*
Hoo-hey!

\chorusmark

I’ll be a man of the land, \\*
I’ll be a man of the trees, \\*
I’ll be a man, wherever my woman will be. \\*
I won’t be any captains mate, \\*
I won’t be servant of the seas; \\*
’Cause this pretty, little, woman, is, all, I, need.
\end{xverse}

\section{The Parting Glass}

\begin{xverse}
Of all the money that e’er I had \\*
I spent it in good company \\*
And all the harm I’ve ever done \\*
Alas, it was to none but me \\*
And all I’ve done for want of wit \\*
To memory now I can’t recall \\*
So fill to me the parting glass \\*
Good night and joy be to you all

So fill to me the parting glass \\*
And drink a health whate’er befalls \\*
Then gently rise and softly call \\*
“Good night and joy be to you all”

Of all the comrades that e’er I had \\*
They’re sorry for my going away \\*
And all the sweethearts that e’er I had \\*
They’d wish me one more day to stay

But since it fell into my lot \\*
That I should rise and you should not \\*
I’ll gently rise and softly call \\*
“Good night and joy be to you all”

But since it fell into my lot \\*
That I should rise and you should not \\*
I’ll gently rise and softly call \\*
“Good night and joy be to you all”

So fill to me the parting glass \\*
And drink a health whate’er befalls \\*
Then gently rise and softly call \\*
“Good night and joy be to you all” \\*
Good night and joy be to you all
\end{xverse}

\section{Spanish Ladies}

\begin{xverse}
Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish Ladies \\*
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain; \\*
For we’ve received orders for to sail for old England \\*
But we hope in a short time to see you again

\chorusdef
We will rant and we’ll roar like true British sailors \\*
We’ll rant and we’ll roar all on the salt seas \\*
Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England; \\*
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues
 
We hove our ship to with the wind from sou’west, boys \\*
We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take; \\*
’Twas forty-five fathoms, with a white sandy bottom \\*
So we squared our main yard and up channel did make

\chorusmark

The first land we sighted was callèd the Dodman \\*
Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight; \\*
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlight and Dover \\*
And then we bore up for the South Foreland light

\chorusmark

Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor \\*
And all in the Downs that night for to lie; \\*
Let go your shank painter, let go your cat stopper \\*
Haul up your clewgarnets, let tacks and sheets fly!

\chorusmark

Now let ev’ry man drink off his full bumper \\*
And let ev’ry man drink off his full bowl; \\*
We’ll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy \\*
And here’s to the health of each true-hearted soul

\chorusmark
\end{xverse}

\section{Seven Drunken Nights}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, as I went home on Monday night \\*
As drunk as drunk could be \\*
I saw a horse outside the door \\*
Where my old horse should be \\*
Well, I called me wife and I said to her \\*
“Will you kindly tell to me \\*
Who owns that horse outside the door, \\*
Where my old horse should be?“ \\*
Ay, you’re drunk, you’re drunk you silly old fool \\*
Still you cannot see \\*
That’s a lovely sow that my mother sent to me \\*
Well, it’s many a day I’ve traveled, a hundred miles or more \\*
But a saddle on a sow, sure, I never saw before

And as I went home on Tuesday night \\*
As drunk as drunk could be \\*
I saw a coat behind the door \\*
Where my old coat should be \\*
Well, I called me wife and I said to her \\*
“Will you kindly tell to me \\*
Who owns that coat behind the door \\*
Where my old coat should be?“ \\*
Ay, you’re drunk, you’re drunk you silly old fool \\*
Still you cannot see \\*
That’s a woolen blanket that me mother sent to me \\*
Well, it’s many a day I’ve traveled, a hundred miles or more \\*
But buttons on a blanket, sure, I never saw before

And as I went home on Wednesday night \\*
As drunk as drunk could be \\*
I saw a pipe upon the chair \\*
Where my old pipe should be \\*
Well, I called my wife and I said to her \\*
“Will you kindly tell to me \\*
Who owns that pipe upon the chair \\*
Where my old pipe should be?“ \\*
Ay, you’re drunk, you’re drunk you silly old fool \\*
Still you cannot see \\*
That’s a lovely tin-whistle, that me mother sent to me \\*
Well, it’s many a day I’ve traveled, a hundred miles or more \\*
But tobacco in a tin-whistle, sure, I never saw before

And I went home on Thursday nigh \\*
As drunk as drunk could be \\*
I saw two boots beneath the bed \\*
Where my old boots should be \\*
Well, I called me wife and I said to her \\*
“Will you kindly tell to me \\*
Who owns them boots beneath the bed \\*
Where my old boots should be?“ \\*
Ay, you’re drunk, you’re drunk you silly old fool \\*
Still you cannot see \\*
They’re two lovely geranium pots me mother sent to me \\*
Well, it’s many a day I’ve traveled, a hundred miles or more \\*
But laces in geranium pots I never saw before

And as I came home on Friday night \\*
As drunk as drunk could be \\*
I saw a head upon the bed \\*
Where my old head should be \\*
Well, I called my wife and I said to her \\*
“Will you kindly tell to me \\*
Who owns that head upon the bed \\*
Where my old head should be?“ \\*
Ay, you’re drunk, you’re drunk you silly old fool \\*
Still you cannot see \\*
That’s a baby boy that me mother sent to me \\*
Well, it’s many a day I’ve traveled, a hundred miles or more \\*
But a baby boy with his whiskers on, sure, I never saw before

\section{Barrett’s Privateers}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, the year was 1778 \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
A letter of marque came from the king \\*
To the scummiest vessel I’ve ever seen \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
For twenty brave men all fishermen who \\*
Would make for him the Antelope’s crew \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
She’d a list to the port and her sails in rags \\*
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

On the King’s birthday we put to sea \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
We were 91 days to Montego Bay \\*
Pumping like madmen all the way \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

On the 96th day we sailed again \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight \\*
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

Now the Yankee lay low down with gold \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays \\*
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

Then at length we stood two cables away \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din \\*
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs \\*
And the Main truck carried off both me legs \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

So here I lay in my 23rd year \\*
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\*
It’s been 6 years since we sailed away \\*
And I just made Halifax yesterday \\*
God damn them all! I was told \\*
We’d cruise the seas for American gold \\*
We’d fire no guns, shed no tears \\*
But I’m a broken man on a Halifax pier \\*
The last of Barrett’s Privateers

\section{Flower of Scotland}

\begin{xverse}
O flower of Scotland \\*
When will we see your like again \\*
That fought and died for \\*
Your wee bit hill and glen \\*
And stood against him \\*
Proud Edward’s army \\*
And sent him homeward \\*
Tae think again

The hills are bare now \\*
And autumn leaves lie thick and still \\*
O’er land that is lost now \\*
Which those so dearly held \\*
And stood against him \\*
Proud Edward’s army \\*
And sent him homeward \\*
Tae think again

Those days are passed now \\*
And in the past they must remain \\*
But we can still rise now \\*
And be the nation again \\*
That stood against him \\*
Proud Edward’s army \\*
And sent him homeward \\*
Tae think again

\section{The Irish Pub Song}

\begin{xverse}
Well, you’re walkin’ through a city street, you could be in Peru \\*
And you hear a distant calling and you know it’s meant for you \\*
Then you drop what you were doing and you join the merry mob \\*
And before you know just where you are, you’re in an Irish pub

\chorusdef
They’ve got one in Honolulu, they’ve got one in Moscow too \\*
They got four of them in Sydney and a couple in Kathmandu \\*
So whether you sing or pull a pint you’ll always have a job \\*
’Cause where ever you go around the world you’ll find an Irish pub

Now that design is fairly simple and it usually works the same, \\*
You’ll have ‘Razor Houghton’ scoring in the Ireland - England game \\*
And you know your in an Irish pub the minute you’re in the door, \\*
For a couple of boys with bodhrans will be murdering Christy Moore

\chorusmark

Now the owner is Norwegian and the manager comes from Cork \\*
And the lad that’s holding up the bar says ‘Only Eejits Work’ \\*
He was born and bred in Bolton but his mammy’s from Kildare \\*
And he’s going to make his fortune soon and move to County Clare

\chorusmark

Now it’s time for me to go, I have to catch me train \\*
So I’ll leave ye sitting at the bar and face the wind and rain \\*
For I’ll have that pint you owe me, if I’m not gone on the dry \\*
When we meet next week in Frankford in the fields of Athenry

\section{On the Banks of the Roses}

\begin{xverse}
\chorusdef
On the Banks of the Roses me love and I sat down \\*
And I took out me fiddle for to play me love a tune \\*
And in the middle of the tune-o she sighed and she said \\*
Oro Johnny, lovely Johnny don’t ya leave me

When I was a young boy I heard me father say \\*
That he’d rather see me dead and buried in the clay \\*
Sooner than be married to any runaway \\*
By the lovely sweet banks of the roses

\chorusmark

And then I am no runaway and soon I’ll let them know \\*
That I can take a bottle or can leave it alone \\*
And if her daddy doesn’t like it he can keep his daughter at home \\*
And young Johnny will go rovin’ with some other

\chorusmark

And when I get married ’twill be in the month of May \\*
When the leaves they are green and the meadows they are gay \\*
And me and me true love we’ll sit and sport and play \\*
By the lovely sweet banks of the roses

\section{For Auld Lang Syne}

\begin{xverse}
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, \\*

Sin auld lang syne.

We twa hae paidl’d i’ the burn, \\*
Frae morning sun till dine; \\*
But seas between us braid hae roar’d \\*
Sin auld lang syne.

And there’s a hand, my trusty fiere! \\*
And gie’s a hand o’ thine! \\*
And we’ll tak a right gude-willy waught, \\*
For auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my jo, \\*
For auld lang syne, \\*
We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet, \\*

\section{A Health to the Company}

\begin{xverse}
Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme \\*
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine \\*
Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain \\*
For we may or might never all meet here again

So here’s a health to the company and one to my lass \\*
Let’s drink and be merry all out of one glass \\*
Let’s drink and be merry, all grief to refrain \\*
For we may or might never all meet here again

Here’s a health to the wee lass that I love so well \\*
For style and for beauty there’s none can excel \\*
There’s a smile on her countenance as she sits upon my knee \\*
There is no man in this wide world as happy as me

So here’s a health to the company and one to my lass \\*
Let’s drink and be merry all out of one glass \\*
Let’s drink and be merry, all grief to refrain \\*
For we may or might never all meet here again

Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock \\*
I wish her safe landing without any shock \\*
And if ever I should meet you by land or by sea \\*
I will always remember your kindness to me

So here’s a health to the company and one to my lass \\*
Let’s drink and be merry all out of one glass \\*
Let’s drink and be merry, all grief to refrain \\*
For we may or might never all meet here again
