\section{Bones in the Ocean}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land \\
And I paddle away from brave England's white sands \\
To search for my long ago forgotten friends \\
To search for the place I hear all sailors’ end \\
As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind \\
I'll search without sleeping 'till peace I can find \\
I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea \\
I remember the fallen, do they think of me? \\
When their bones in the ocean forever will be \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
Plot a course thro' the night to a place I once knew \\
To a place where my hope died along with my crew \\
So I swallow my grief and face life's final test \\
To find promise of peace and the solace of rest \\
As the songs of the dead fill the space of my ears \\
Their laughter like children, their beckoning cheers \\
My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea \\
I remember the fallen, do they think of me? \\
When their bones in the ocean forever will be \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand \\
I shed a small tear for my home upon land \\
Though their eyes speak of depths filled with struggle and strife \\
Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life \\
As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes \\
And my boat listed over and tried to capsize. \\
I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea, \\
I remember the living do they think of me? \\
When my bones in the ocean forever will be. \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss \\
I'm not sure what I want but I don't think it's this \\
As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on \\
I make sail for the dawn 'till the darkness has gone \\
As the souls of the dead live for'er in my mind \\
As I live all the years that they left me behind \\
I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea \\
I remember the fallen and they think of me \\
For our souls in the ocean together will be. \\
I remember the fallen and they think of me, \\
For our souls in the ocean together will be \\
\end{xverse}


\section{Santiana}

\begin{xverse}
Oh Santiana gained the day \\
Away Santiana \\
Now pulled the yan up the west they say \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
Well heave her up and away we'll go \\
Away Santiana \\
Heave her up and away we'll go \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
She's a fast clipper ship and a bully good crew \\
Away Santiana \\
And an old salty Yank for a captain too \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
Santiana fought for gold \\
Away Santiana \\
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\

Twas on the field of Molly-Del-Rey \\
Away Santiana \\
Well both his legs got blown away \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\

\begin{xverse}
It was a fierce and bitter strife \\
Away Santiana \\
The general Taylor took his life \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
Santiana now we mourn \\
Away Santiana \\
We left him buried off Cape Horn \\
Along the plains of Mexico \\

\section{Loch Lomond}

\begin{xverse}
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes, \\
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond, \\
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae, \\
In the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
O ye’ll take the high road, and I’ll take the low road, \\
And I’ll be in Scotland afore ye, \\
Where me and my true love will never meet again, \\
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
‘Twas there that we parted, in by yon shady glen, \\
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond, \\
Where, deep in purple hue, the highland hills we view, \\
And the moon coming out in the gloaming. \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring, \\
And in sunshine waters lie sleeping. \\
But the broken heart it kens, nae second spring again, \\
Though the waeful may cease frae their greeting. \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark


\section{Beeswing}
\begin{xverse}
I was 18 when I came to town they called it the summer of love \\
Burning babies burning flags the hawks against the doves \\
I took a job at the steaming way down on Caltrim St, \\
Fell in love with a laundry girl that was workin’ next to me. \\
Brown hair zig zagged across her face and a look of half surprise, \\
Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes, \\
She said to me can’t you see I’m not the factory kind, \\
If you don’t take me out of here I’ll surely lose my mind \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
She was a rare thing fine as a bee’s wing \\
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away \\
She was a lost child, she was runnin’ wild (she said) \\
So long as there’s no price on love I’ll stay \\
You wouldn’t want me any other way. \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
We busked around the market towns fruit pickin’ down in Kent \\
We could tinker pots and pans or knives wherever we went. \\
We were campin down the Gower one time, the work was mighty good. \\
She wouldn’t wait for the harvest, I thought we should. \\
I said to her we’ll settle down, get a few acres dug, \\
A fire burning in the hearth and babbies on the rug. \\
She said Oh man you foolish man that surely sounds like hell, \\
You might be lord of half the world,You’ll not own me as well \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
We were drinking more in those days our tempers reached a pitch \\
Like a fool I let her run away when she took the rambling itch. \\
Last I heard she was living rough back on the Derby beat \\
A bottle of White Horse in her pocket, a Wolfhound at her feet \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
They say that she got married once to a man called Romany Brown \\
Even a gypsy caravan was too much like settlin’ down \\
They say her rose has faded, rough weather and hard booze, \\
Maybe thats the price you pay for the chains that you refuse \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee’s wing \\
I miss her more than ever words can say \\
If I could just taste all of her wildness now \\
If I could hold her in my arms today… \\
I wouldn’t want her any other way \\
\end{xverse}


\section{Leave her Johnny leave her}

\begin{xverse}
I thought I heard the Old Man say: \\
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her." \\
Tomorrow you will get your pay \\
And it's time for us to leave her \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
Leave her, Johnny, leave her! \\
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her! \\
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow \\
And it's time for us to leave her \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, the wind was foul and the sea ran high \\
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her!" \\
She shipped it green and none went by \\
And it's time for us to leave her \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
I hate to sail on this rotten tub \\
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her!" \\
No grog allowed and rotten grub \\
And it's time for us to leave her \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
We swear by rote for want of more \\
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her!" \\
But now we're through so we'll go on shore \\
And it's time for us to leave her \\
\end{xverse}

\section{Northwest Passage}

\begin{chorus}
Ah, for just one time \\
I would take the Northwest Passage \\
To find the hand of Franklin \\
Reaching for the Beaufort Sea \\
Tracing one warm line \\
Through a land so wild and savage \\
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea \\
Westward from the Davis Strait \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
'Tis there 'twas said to lie \\
The sea route to the Orient \\
For which so many died \\
Seeking gold and glory, \\
Leaving weathered, broken bones \\
And a long-forgotten lonely cairn of stones \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
Three centuries thereafter \\
I take passage overland \\
In the footsteps of brave Kelso \\
Where his “sea of flowers" began \\
Watching cities rise before me \\
Then behind me sink again \\
This tardiest explorer \\
Driving hard across the plain \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
And through the night, behind the wheel \\
The mileage clicking west \\
I think upon Mackenzie, \\
David Thompson and the rest \\
Who cracked the mountain ramparts \\
And did show a path for me \\
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
How then am I so different \\
From the first men through this way? \\
Like them, I left a settled life \\
I threw it all away \\
To seek a Northwest Passage \\
At the call of many men \\
To find there but the road back home again \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark


\section{The Mingulay Boat Song}

Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\
Heave her head round to the weather \\
Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\
Sailing homeward to Mingulay \\
\end{chorus}

What care we though white the Minch is \\
What care we boys the wind and weather \\
When we know that, every inch is \\
Closer homeward to Mingulay \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
Wives are waiting by the pierhead \\
Gazing seaward from the heather \\
Heave ahead round and we'll anchor \\
Ere the sun sets on Mingulay \\
\end{xverse}

Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\
Heave her head round to the weather \\
Heel ya ho, boys, let her go, boys \\
Sailing homeward to Mingulay \\
Sailing homeward to Mingulay \\
\end{xverse}


\section{The Skye Boat Song}

\begin{chorus}
Speed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing \\
Onward the sailors cry. \\
Carry the lad that's born to be king \\
Over the sea to Skye \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
Loud the wind howls \\
Loud the waves roar \\
Thunderclaps rend the air \\
Baffled our foes \\
Stand by the shore \\
Follow they will not dare \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
Many's the lad fought on that day \\
Well the claymore did wield \\
When the night came \\
Silently lain \\
Dead on Colloden field \\

Though the waves heave \\
Soft will ye sleep \\
Ocean's a royal bed \\
Rocked in the deep \\
Flora will keep \\
Watch by your weary head \\

\section{Wild Mountain Thyme}

O the summer time has come \\
And the trees are sweetly bloomin' \\
And the wild mountain thyme \\
Grows around the bloomin' heather \\
Will ye go, Lassie, go? \\

And we'll all go together \\
To pull wild mountain thyme \\
All around the bloomin' heather \\
Will ye go, Lassie, go? \\

By yon cool crystal fountain \\
And round it I will pile \\
All the wild flowers o' the mountain \\

And the deep glen sae dreamy \\
And return wi' their spoils \\
Tae the bower o' my dearie \\

\section{The Wild Rover}

\begin{xverse}
I've been a wild rover for many's the year \\
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer \\
But now I'm returning with gold in great store \\
And I never will play the wild rover no more \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
And it's no, nay, never \\
No, nay, never no more \\
Will I play the wild rover \\
No, never no more \\

I went into an alehouse I used to frequent \\
And I told the landlady me money was spent \\
I asked her for credit, she answered me “nay" \\
"Such a custom as yours I can have every day"
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
I then took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright \\
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight \\
She says “I have whiskeys and wines of the best" \\
And the words that you told me were only in jest \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I'd done \\
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son \\

\section{Caledonia}

\begin{xverse}
I don't know if you can see \\
the changes that have come over me \\
In these last few days I've been afraid \\
that I might drift away \\
So I've been telling old stories, singing songs \\
that make me think about where I come from \\
And that's the reason why I seem so far away today \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
Oh and let me tell you that I love you \\
and I think about you all the time \\
Caledonia, you're calling me and now I'm going home \\
If I should become a stranger \\
you know that it would make me more than sad \\
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
Oh and I have moved on and I've kept on moving \\
proved the points that I needed proving \\
Lost the friends that I needed losing \\
found others on the way \\
Oh and I have tried and I've kept on trying \\
stolen dreams, yes there's no denying \\
I have travelled hard, with my conscience flying, \\
somewhere with the wind \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
Now I'm sitting here before the fire \\
the empty room, the forest choir \\
The flames that couldn't get any higher \\
they've withered now they've gone \\
But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear \\
and I know what I will do tomorrow \\
When the hands have shaken and the kisses flowed \\
then I will disappear \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark


\section{Rocky Road to Dublin}

\begin{xverse}
While in the merry month of May, now from me home I started \\
Left, the girls of Tuam were nearly broken-hearted \\
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother \\
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother \\
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born \\
Cut a stout, black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins \\
A brand-new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs \\
And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{chorus}
One, two, three, four, five \\
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road \\
And all the way to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{xverse}
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary \\
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early \\
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from shrinking \\
That’s the Paddy’s cure whene’er he's on for drinking \\
To hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while \\
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a-bubblin' \\
They asked me was I hired and wages I required to lay \\
Was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
 
In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity \\
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city \\
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality \\
Bundle it was stolen, in a neat locality \\
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind \\
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin' \\
'Quiring after the rogue, said me Connaught brogue \\
It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
From there I got away, me spirits never falling \\
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing \\
Captain at me roared, said that no room had he \\
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy \\
Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs \\
I played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling \\
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead \\
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin \\
\end{xverse}

\chorusmark

\begin{xverse}
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed \\
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it \\
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing \\
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing \\
"Hurrah me soul" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly \\
Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin' \\
With a “lo!" and “hurray!" they joined in the affray \\
Quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin \\
\end{xverse}

\section{Whiskey in the jar}

\begin{xverse}
It's as I was going over the Cork and Kerry Mountains \\

\chorusmark
\begin{xverse}
I went into my chamber for to take a little slumber \\
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder \\

and sent for Captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter \\
\end{xverse}
\chorusmark
\begin{xverse}
It was early in the mornin' before I rose to travel \\
surrounded by the footmen and likewise Captain Farrel \\
I went for my old pistol for they'd stolen my old rapier \\
but I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken \\
\end{xverse}
\chorusmark
\begin{xverse}
If anyone can save me it's my brother in the army \\
I think that he is stationed in Cork or in Killarney \\

\section{Seven Drunken Nights}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, as I went home on Monday night \\
As drunk as drunk could be \\
I saw a horse outside the door \\
Where my old horse should be \\
Well, I called me wife and I said to her \\
"Will you kindly tell to me \\
Who owns that horse outside the door, \\
Where my old horse should be?" \\
Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool \\
Still you cannot see \\
That's a lovely sow that my mother sent to me \\
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more \\
But a saddle on a sow, sure, I never saw before \\

And as I went home on Tuesday night \\
As drunk as drunk could be \\

Where my old coat should be \\
Well, I called me wife and I said to her \\
"Will you kindly tell to me \\
Who owns that coat behind the door \\
Where my old coat should be?" \\
Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool \\

"Will you kindly tell to me \\
Who owns that pipe upon the chair \\
Where my old pipe should be?" \\
Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool \\
Still you cannot see \\
That's a lovely tin-whistle, that me mother sent to me \\

Who owns them boots beneath the bed \\
Where my old boots should be?" \\
Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool \\
Still you cannot see \\
They're two lovely geranium pots me mother sent to me \\
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more \\
But laces in geranium pots I never saw before \\

And as I came home on Friday night \\
As drunk as drunk could be \\
I saw a head upon the bed \\
Where my old head should be \\

Who owns that head upon the bed \\
Where my old head should be?" \\

\section{Barrett's Privateers}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, the year was 1778 \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
A letter of marque came from the king \\
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
For twenty brave men all fishermen who \\
Would make for him the Antelope's crew \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags \\
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
On the King's birthday we put to sea \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
We were 91 days to Montego Bay \\
Pumping like madmen all the way \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
On the 96th day we sailed again \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight \\
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
Now the Yankee lay low down with gold \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays \\
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
Then at length we stood two cables away \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din \\
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs \\
And the Main truck carried off both me legs \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\
\end{xverse}

\begin{xverse}
So here I lay in my 23rd year \\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now \\
It's been 6 years since we sailed away \\
And I just made Halifax yesterday \\
God damn them all! I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers \\

Well, you're walkin' through a city street, you could be in Peru \\
And you hear a distant calling and you know it's meant for you \\
Then you drop what you were doing and you join the merry mob \\
And before you know just where you are, you're in an Irish pub \\

They've got one in Honolulu, they've got one in Moscow too \\
They got four of them in Sydney and a couple in Kathmandu \\
So whether you sing or pull a pint you'll always have a job \\
'Cause where ever you go around the world you'll find an Irish pub \\

Now that design is fairly simple and it usually works the same, \\
You'll have 'Razor Houghton' scoring in the Ireland - England game \\
